# weather-app

An app that displays the current weather in Chicago.
Mainly for experimenting with calling an external API, while continuing to practice formatting.
I will add features as I continue to learn JS and other technologies.

TO-DO

1. Implement an input that allows the user to get the weather in any location
2. Modify weather icon to either just be bigger or be a full-page background image
3. (Future) Display historical weather data for this day in history,
   graph current and historical data to demonstrate how present-day weather
   compares to that of the past - essentially a not-so-scientific visual
   representation of the extent to which climate change has affected the
   given location

DONE

1. Basic Markup and Styling
2. JS to call OpenWeatherMap API using AJAX XHR and
   parse the JSON to display current weather data
3. Switch styling to Bootstrap with customization
